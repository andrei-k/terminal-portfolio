# ðŸ’» Terminal Style Portfolio Website

My [portfolio](https://12ak.com) built with LiveTerm

A modified version of [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm) for my personal website. Please see the creator's repo for more info and to generate a similar website.

## Modifications

I removed certain commands that aren't relevant to me, such as `donate`, `quote`, and `weather`. And I added a few new commands, including: `status`, `skills`, `soundcloud`. I plan to add more commands in the near future!

## Usage

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

## Deployed on Vercel

I connected my GitHub account to Vercel, which automatically deploys the repo.

# ðŸ’» Terminal Style Portfolio Website

A modified version of [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm) for my personal [website](https://12ak.com). Please see the creator's repo for more info and to generate a similar website.

## Modifications

I removed certain commands that aren't relevant to me, such as `donate`, `quote`, and `weather`. And I added a few new commands, including: `status`, `skills`, `soundcloud`. I plan to add more commands in the near future!

## Usage

If Yarn is not installed:
```bash
sudo npm install --global yarn
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deployed on Vercel

I connected my GitHub account to Vercel, which automatically deploys the repo.
